# simple-youtube-playlist-downloader
A simple, multithreaded YouTube playlist downloader in Python for mp3 which I made in like an hour, so don't expect too much as of now.  
Download only stuff you are allowed to, I take no responsibilities for anything.  

For now it collects all the Videos in the playlist and then converts them to mp3. While converting to mp3 the mp4 is still there, so just dont pay it any attention.  

Requirements:  
pytube  
tkinter  
moviepi
